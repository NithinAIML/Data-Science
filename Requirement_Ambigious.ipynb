Could this be due to CTI Agent log job was off in between?\\r\\n\\r\\n3   Please refer to attached screenshots and below reports for your reference  \\r\\n\\r\\nLet me know in case of any further questions on this  Mismatch of records between CTI agent logs and Calls from CTI  Ideally CTI agent log should also have reference of those 7 inbound calls  There are still 3172 records that has owner as your name Preventive : What can we do to avoid this kind of issues in future? Is it possible to have some kind of alert mechanism in place in case these CTI jobs fails so you/admin would be notified when it fails  So when we pull Contact history report (in CTI) and compared with Task report for same agent that is matching  CTI Agent Log: owner should be agent name  Currently CTI Agent log is having Agent Offered as 3 and Inbound Calls handled as 3 \\r\\nHere is what we observed today  Gabriel Behar CTI agent log report -
